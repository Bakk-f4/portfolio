# This is my first website in React

If you want to load your Repositories from github using the API just put inside [src](/src/) folder \
your github token in a file named `github_token.json` 

Json file example: 
```
{
    "token": "your_token"
}
```

If you find anything wrong or need improvement, please feel free to PR. \
I hope this portfolio will be useful to someone as a base from which to start building their own site.
